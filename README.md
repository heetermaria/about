# About 

I'm a reporter at The Information covering venture capital. I focus on late-stage startups, IPOs and crossover funds. 

I previously reported on real estate for Bloomberg News and business/Covid-19 for the Sacramento Bee. I was also the editor-in-chief for The Student Life, the student newspaper of the seven Claremont Colleges. I recently graduated from Scripps College, where I studied economics and researched the housing market. I'm interested in economic analysis, datasets and all things confidential.
